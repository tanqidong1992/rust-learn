The Java programming language is strongly and statically typed.
This specification clearlydistinguishes between the compile-time errors that can and must be detected at compile time,
andthose that occur at run time.
Compile time normally consists of translating programs into a machine-independent byte code representation.
Run-time activities include loading and linking of the classesneeded to execute a program,
optional machine code generation and dynamic optimization of theprogram, and actual program execution.
